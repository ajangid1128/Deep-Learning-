# Deep-Learning-

* Hand Digit Recognition
1) Flatten Image into a column vector (reshape)
2) Applied Artificial Neural Network with only input and output in network 
3) Construct Artificial Neural Network from both scratch (Hypothesis Function -> Loss/Cost -> Gradients) & using tensorflow and keras
 
* Customer Churn Prediction
1) Data Cleaning -- convert categorical features into binary representation, removal of unwanted columns, one-hot encoding
2) Min-Max Scaling
3) Deep Neural Network with 2 hidden layer 

* Image Classifition CNN with Data Augmentation (flower multiclass classification)
 1) Data Visualization using PIL 
 2) Data loading using cv2.imread()
 3) Applied CNN with 2 Maxpooling, 2 CNN_relu layer, a flatten layer and finally articial neural network layer for classification. 
 4) Overcome Overfitting using Data Augmentation
